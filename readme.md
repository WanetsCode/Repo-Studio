Repo studio is a powerful html studio, that runs real-time html previews and saves your data only using your github repos. 

------------

# How to use:
1. Go to the [studio console](http://repostudio.vercel.app/console "studio console") and type ```
load octokit.[Your github username]
```.
2. The system will open a new window where you should give Repo Studio the permission to edit, delete and create files. Please allow of these!
3. Using the built in editor you can create, delete and edit the files in the reposistory. The files will automatically update. You can set the preview to use your github pages site and update the site when you finish coding.
