**Repo Studio** is a powerful HTML studio that offers real-time HTML previews and saves your work directly to your GitHub repositories.

<h1 align="center">How to Use Repo Studio</h1>

1. Go to the [studio console](http://repostudio.vercel.app/console) and type:
   
   `load octokit.[YourGitHubUsername]`

2. Once your account is loaded, type:
   
   `octokit.perms`

   This grants Repo Studio permission to edit files in your GitHub repositories.

3. A new window will open, prompting you to grant Repo Studio permission to edit, delete, and create files within your GitHub repositories.

4. Use the built-in editor to create, delete, and modify files in the repository. Changes update automatically, and you can set the preview to display on your GitHub Pages site. Update your site once you've finished coding.

<h1 align="center">Why was Repo Studio created?</h1>
<h2 align="center">(and why should I use it?)</h2>

Repo Studio is an alternative to many compilers or studios designed to show your code in real-time and save it to your profile. Unfortunately, some other platforms may not save your data or may require payment for extra features, memory, or support for additional code types. Repo Studio is completely free and allows for community-driven extensions on GitHub using the Repo Studio API. 

*Access these extensions by typing `addon.add`, `addon.list`, or `addon.github` in the [studio console](http://repostudio.vercel.app/console "studio console").*
