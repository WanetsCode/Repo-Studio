**Repo Studio** is a powerful HTML studio that provides real-time HTML previews and saves your work using only your GitHub repositories.

------------

# How to Use

1. Go to the [studio console](http://repostudio.vercel.app/console "studio console") and type:

    ```plaintext
    load octokit.[YourGitHubUsername]
    ```

2. A new window will open, prompting you to grant Repo Studio permission to edit, delete, and create files in your GitHub repository. Please allow all of these permissions.

3. Use the built-in editor to create, delete, and edit files in the repository. The files update automatically, and you can set the preview to display on your GitHub Pages site. Update the site once youâ€™ve finished coding.
